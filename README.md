NMA - Notify my android

NMA is a message API for sending the events to your android phone or tablet.
You need to register at: https://www.notifymyandroid.com/ and make an API key.
Second you have to enter the API key at the event settings (at emoncms).
Beware that you have a treshold of only 5 messages a day with a trial account!

MQTT will require access to an MQTT broker. (like: http://mosquitto.org/ for a raspberry pi).
MQTT (Telemetry Transport) is a protocol designed for sending telemetry from devices in situations where bandwidth is very limited. Because of this, is an extremely light-weight protocol, and at a mere 42 pages the protocol specification is light-weight too.
